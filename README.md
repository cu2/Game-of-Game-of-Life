Red pixels follow the rules of [Conway's Game of Life](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life). If your spaceship touches them, it loses HP. Except when its shield is active, in which case the pixels touched are destroyed. Your goal is the annihilate all the pixels as fast as possible.

In the upper left corner is the HP of your ship, on the top in the middle is your shield (it loads continuously), in the upper right corner is the time elapsed. Control: speed up ship - UP key, slow down ship - DOWN key, steer ship - LEFT/RIGHT keys, activate shield - SPACE key.

Game of Game of Life was created by [Zanda Games](http://zandagames.com/) in 2011 for a Hungarian 72 hours game developer competition (theme: Pixels).
